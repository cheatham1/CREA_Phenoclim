# CREA

CREA Mont-Blanc is a scientific NGO whose mission is to explore the impact of climate change on biodiversity and to share this knowledge with decision-makers and citizens.

# Phenology

The Phenoclim program seeks to measure and understand the impact of climatic changes on the phenology (seasonal rhythms) of different species found in mountain environments. In spring and fall, common tree and plant speicies as well as bird species are monitored by CREA Mont-Blanc’s researchers and volunteers across the Alps.
Phenoclim is a participatory science program, and since 2004 has received contributions from over 5,000 citizen scientists, including several hundred who participate every year.

Phénoclim est un programme scientifique et pédagogique initié en 2004 par le Centre de Recherches sur les Écosystèmes d'Altitude (CREA) qui invite le public à mesurer l'impact du changement climatique sur la faune et la flore en montagne par le biais d'un programme scientifique participatif.

This dashboard (generated with the help of Claude.ai) focuses on 4 tree species in 6 regions (Corsica currently only has 14 observations so is not shown).

The four visualizations:

📈 Tendances — Phenological timing over 20 years for the 4 main species, filterable by stage (débourrement, feuillaison, floraison, changement de couleur). This reveals year-to-year variability and potential climate-driven shifts — for instance, hazel flowering has been trending earlier, reaching as early as February 4th in 2020.

⛰️ Altitude — The altitudinal gradient of bud break, showing how spring arrives ~3 days later for every 100 m gain in elevation. Birch buds open 46 days later at 1800 m than at 200 m. This is a vivid, tangible result that participants can relate to from their own sites.

🗺️ Régions — Comparing phenology across the Alps, Pyrenees, Mont-Blanc, Massif Central, Jura, and Vosges. The Massif Central springs to life earliest, while high-altitude regions lag behind.

🤝 Votre impact — An observation counter (51,800+ total) and motivational summary of why continued participation matters: the 21-year time series is scientifically irreplaceable, and the altitude/geographic coverage is impossible to replicate with automated stations.

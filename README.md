# CREA

CREA Mont-Blanc is a scientific NGO whose mission is to explore the impact of climate change on biodiversity and to share this knowledge with decision-makers and citizens.

# Phenology

The Phenoclim program seeks to measure and understand the impact of climatic changes on the phenology (seasonal rhythms) of different species found in mountain environments. In spring and fall, ten common tree and plant speicies as well as eleven bird species are monitored by CREA Mont-Blanc’s researchers and volunteers across the Alps.
Phenoclim is a participatory science program, and since 2004 has received contributions from over 5,000 citizen scientists, including several hundred who participate every year.

Phénoclim est un programme scientifique et pédagogique initié en 2004 par le Centre de Recherches sur les Écosystèmes d'Altitude (CREA) qui invite le public à mesurer l'impact du changement climatique sur la faune et la flore en montagne par le biais d'un programme scientifique participatif.
